## Bilkent CS353 Database Systems Term Project

We were prompted to create a local events application:
>For this project, you will implement the database for a social networking application
where the users create and join local events such as gatherings, concerts, games, etc.
Users can see the events happening around them based on their locations. If the events
require tickets, the users should be able to purchase them through the system. The
database should support some search filters such as age restrictions of the events and
types of events (e.g., sports, art, social gathering, music, etc.). There should be some
other restrictions in the system. For example, the details of the events should only be
edited by the user who created them. The system also has an admin user who can create
system reports like finding the most popular events in a month based on the number of
people who attended etc.

We have used HTML and Javascript for the pages, PHP for connecting them to the database, and SQL for the database itself.
